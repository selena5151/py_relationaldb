# Relational Database with dataframe
This project provides a custom Relation class, which extends the functionality of a pandas DataFrame to support relational algebra operations. This class includes methods for common database operations, including selection, projection, cartesian product, renaming columns, union, difference, and intersection. It reads data from an SQLite database and allows you to interact with it in a command-line environment.

## Files

  * **schema.xlsx:** The schema with chinook.db.
